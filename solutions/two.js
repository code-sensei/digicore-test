/** QUESTION 2
 * In a game of table tennis, two players play against each other in a round of 5. The person with
 * the higher score in round of 5 is leading the other by 1 point. Given a series of output between
 * two players Tom and Jack in table tennis. Output the overall score point by each player in the
 * right order.
 *      a. NB: No point is awarded when both player have same score for same round of game
 *      Input Tom [1, 4, 7, 2, 4] Jack [3, 4, 2, 4, 4] Output [1, 2] Tom led Jack in 1 game,
 *      Jack led Tom in 2 games and they had an equal score in 2 games. Hence our output
 *      is [1, 2] with Tomâ€™s score coming first
